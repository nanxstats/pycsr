# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Python for Clinical Study Reports and Submission.
Clinical study reports (CSRs) sit at the heart of clinical trial development.
They bring the design, analysis, and interpretation of a study together
in an integrated document.

This book shows how to use Python to plan, build, and automate CSRs,
from data and analyses to tables, figures, and listings.
We follow the [ICH E3 guidance on structure and content
](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E3_Guideline.pdf) and
demonstrate practical, reproducible workflows that help you meet those expectations.

Whether you are new to Python or already working in clinical reporting,
you will find small, reusable examples you can adopt right away,
along with patterns and checklists for organizing work for
regulatory submission and effective team collaboration.

**This is a work-in-progress draft.**
