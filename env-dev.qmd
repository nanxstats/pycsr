title: "Python developer setup"
---

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Set up a productive Python development environment for clinical study reporting.
Learn about IDE options, essential extensions, and workflow tools.
:::

## Development environments

For this book, you have several options for your development environment.
Choose the one that best fits your current setup and constraints.

### GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment with
everything pre-configured. This is the easiest option if you don't have
a local Python setup.

We will provide a dev container configuration that includes:

- Python with uv pre-installed.
- Quarto pre-installed for document rendering.
- All necessary VS Code extensions.
- Consistent environment across all readers, useable in the web browser.

To use a pre-configured Codespaces for this book,
use the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button below.

To use a pre-configured Codespaces for this book,
follow the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" link below.

<https://codespaces.new/nanxstats/pycsr?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json>

:::

Click "Create new Codespace", you will see a notification
"Setting up remote connection: Building codespace..."
After two or three minutes, your Codespace will be ready with everything set up.

::: callout-note
Codespaces currently offers [120 hours of free compute time per month
](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces#free-and-billed-use-by-personal-accounts)
for personal accounts.
This is more than sufficient for this book.
:::

::: callout-caution
Remember to [stop your Codespace](
https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace) after this workshop to avoid unnecessary usage.
We will remind you at the end of this book.

### Positron

Positron is Posit's next-generation data science IDE,
built on Code OSS (the open source core of VS Code),
with specific improvements for R and Python development.

Key features for Python work:

- Native notebook support.
- Interactive variable explorer.
- Integrated plot viewer.
- Built-in data viewer for DataFrames.

::: aside
Positron uses Open VSX instead of the Microsoft VS Code marketplace.
Most essential Python extensions are available, but the selection is more limited.

Download Positron from <https://positron.posit.co/>.

### VS Code

Visual Studio Code remains the most popular choice for Python development.
It offers a rich ecosystem of extensions and tools.

Essential extensions for this book:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python):
  Core Python language support.
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance):
  Fast, feature-rich Python language server.
- [Ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff):
  Lightning-fast Python code linting and formatting.
- [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml):
  Syntax highlighter and formatter for TOML files.
- [Quarto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto):
  Authoring support for Quarto documents.
- [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop):
  LaTeX authoring support; used here for PDF preview.

## VS Code settings

### Unicode highlighting

Python allows Unicode characters in strings and identifiers.
AI coding tools might also generate code with non-ASCII characters.
For regulatory work, you should highlight non-ASCII characters
to find these hidden issues early and avoid problems in submissions.

**Via Settings UI:**

1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Search for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"
3. Search for "Unicode Highlight"
4. Enable "Non Basic ASCII" for both trusted and untrusted workspaces

**Via Settings JSON:**

Open Command Palette with Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P,
select "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)", then add:

```json
"editor.unicodeHighlight.nonBasicASCII": true
```

This highlights characters like curly quotes, em dashes, and other non-ASCII
characters that could cause issues in eCTD submission packages.

## Terminal setup

For local development, you will interact with uv and Quarto through the terminal.

### Shell

Any modern shell works well:

- macOS/Linux: zsh (default on macOS), bash
- Windows: PowerShell, Windows Terminal

### Terminal emulator

If you are on macOS and want a faster terminal experience,
consider [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).
It is written in Zig for exceptional performance.

## AI coding assistants

Modern agentic AI coding tools can accelerate statistical and clinical
coding tasks, especially for popular programming languages like Python.
We encourage you to use them, for example:

- Codex (command-line interface, VS Code extension)
- Claude Code (command-line interface)
- Cursor (AI-first editor)
- GitHub Copilot (VS Code extension)

### Effective use of AI tools

To use AI assistants effectively for programming, you need:

**Product manager mindset**:
Know exactly what you want to build. In clinical reporting, this means
understanding the table shell, statistical method, and regulatory requirements.

**Software architect mindset**:
Evaluate model outputs critically. Can you spot issues with
data transformations? Do the statistical computations match the statistical analysis plan?
Is the output format submission-ready?

::: callout-warning
AI tools are assistants, not replacements for domain expertise.
Always verify outputs against statistical analysis plans and regulatory guidance.

## What's next

With your development environment configured, you are ready to learn about uv,
the modern project management tool for Python.

In the next chapter, we will cover:

- Creating and managing Python projects.
- Pinning Python versions.
- Installing dependencies.
- Understanding the modern Python packaging ecosystem.
