## Project structure FAQ

Dedicated Python package repo, dedicated eCTD project repo (Yilong will create).

If you have to use both R and Python:
Separate Python package directory and R package directory.
Can share input and output paths.
It's almost a mistake to mix language in a single project (John Carmack).

We will focus on Python project only in this book.
