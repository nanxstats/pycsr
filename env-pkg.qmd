title: "Python package toolchain"
---

::: callout-tip
## Objective

Learn the essential development tools for Python projects: formatting, linting, type checking, testing, and documentation. Build a professional development workflow for clinical reporting.
:::

## The modern Python toolchain

In R, packages like `devtools`, `usethis`, `styler`, `lintr`, and `testthat`
provide development infrastructure. Python's ecosystem distributes these
functions across specialized tools.

For clinical reporting projects, we recommend:

- **uv**: Package and environment management.
- **Ruff**: Code formatting and linting.
- **mypy**: Static type checking.
- **pytest**: Unit testing framework.
- **quartodoc**: Documentation and reporting.

::: aside
For R users, think of this as: uv = renv + pak + devtools,
Ruff = styler + lintr, pytest = testthat, mypy = (no direct R equivalent).
:::

All tools are installed as development dependencies and configured
through `pyproject.toml`.

## Ruff: Formatting and linting

Ruff is an super fast linter and formatter written in Rust.
It replaces multiple legacy tools (Black, isort, Flake8, pyupgrade)
with a single, consistent interface.

### Installation

Add Ruff as a development dependency:

```bash
uv add --dev ruff
```

### Code formatting

Format your code:

```bash
uv run ruff format
```

Or using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx ruff format
```

Ruff format:

- Enforces consistent style (like Black).
- Sorts imports automatically.
- Removes trailing whitespace.
- Ensures consistent line lengths.

### Linting

Check for linting issues:

```bash
uv run ruff check
```

Fix auto-fixable issues:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix
```

Ruff detects:

- Unused imports and variables.
- Undefined names.
- Style violations.
- Common anti-patterns.
- Security issues.

### Configuration

Add Ruff configuration to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py313"

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E",    # pycodestyle
    "F",    # Pyflakes
    "UP",   # pyupgrade
    "B",    # flake8-bugbear
    "SIM",  # flake8-simplify
    "I",    # isort
]
ignore = []
```

::: callout-note
Line length of 88 characters is the Python community standard.
It balances readability with modern screen sizes.
:::

## Type checking with mypy

Python supports optional type annotations through
[PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/).
Type annotations improve code clarity and catch errors before runtime.

### Why type checking matters

For clinical programming:

- Catch data transformation errors at development time.
- Document expected DataFrame structures.
- Improve IDE autocomplete and refactoring.
- Reduce runtime errors in production.

### Installation

Add mypy as a development dependency:

```bash
uv add --dev mypy
```

### Basic usage

Check types in your code:

```bash
uv run mypy .
```

### Type annotation example

Without types:

```python
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    return weight / (height ** 2)
```

With types:

```python
def calculate_bmi(weight: float, height: float) -> float:
    """Calculate BMI from weight (kg) and height (m)."""
    return weight / (height ** 2)
```

The type checker verifies:

- Arguments are the correct type.
- Return value matches the declared type.
- Operations are valid for the types used.

### Configuration

Add mypy settings to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.13"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = false
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
check_untyped_defs = true
no_implicit_optional = true
```

::: aside
Start with lenient settings (`disallow_untyped_defs = false`) and
progressively tighten as you add type annotations to your codebase.
:::

### Type stubs for libraries

Some libraries don't include type information. Install type stubs when available:

```bash
uv add --dev types-tabulate
```

::: callout-note
Popular data science libraries like `polars` include built-in type annotations.
Older libraries like `pandas` require separate stub packages (`pandas-stubs`).
:::

## Testing with pytest

pytest is Python's de facto standard testing framework.
It's more powerful and ergonomic than the built-in `unittest` module.

### Installation

Add pytest and coverage tools:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest pytest-cov
```

### Writing tests

Create a `tests/` directory:

```
pycsr-example/
├── src/
│   └── pycsr_example/
│       └── __init__.py
└── tests/
    └── test_calculations.py
```

Write a simple test in `tests/test_calculations.py`:

```python
from pycsr_example.calculations import calculate_bmi
import pytest

def test_calculate_bmi():
    # Normal BMI calculation
    assert calculate_bmi(70, 1.75) == pytest.approx(22.857142857142858)

def test_calculate_bmi_underweight():
    # BMI < 18.5 indicates underweight
    assert calculate_bmi(50, 1.75) < 18.5
```

### Running tests

Run all tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run with verbose output:

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

Run specific test file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_calculations.py
```

### Code coverage

Generate coverage report:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=pycsr_example --cov-report=term
```

Generate HTML coverage report:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=pycsr_example --cov-report=html
```

This creates `htmlcov/index.html` showing which lines are tested.

::: callout-important
For regulatory submissions, high test coverage demonstrates code quality.
Aim for >80% coverage for critical data transformation and
statistical computation functions.
:::

### pytest configuration

Add pytest settings to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = [
    "--strict-markers",
    "--strict-config",
    "-ra",
]
```

## Documentation generation

For clinical reporting projects, documentation serves two purposes:

1. **Code documentation**: Function and module documentation.
2. **Report generation**: Analysis reports and TLFs.

### Quarto for reports

We use Quarto for creating reproducible analysis documents:

```bash
# Install Quarto separately (not via uv)
# See: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
```

Quarto documents (`.qmd` files) combine:

- Markdown text.
- Python code cells.
- Generated outputs (tables, listings, figures).

This book itself is written in Quarto.

### quartodoc for API documentation

For packages that need API documentation (similar to R's `pkgdown`), use `quartodoc`:

```bash
uv add --dev quartodoc
```

quartodoc generates documentation from docstrings and integrates with Quarto
for full website generation.

::: aside
For analysis projects (rather than reusable packages),
Quarto alone is usually sufficient. Use `quartodoc` when building
analysis packages for team to collaborate on.
:::

## Development workflow

Putting it all together, a typical development cycle looks like:

1. **Format code**: `uv run ruff format`
2. **Check linting**: `uv run ruff check --fix`
3. **Verify types**: `uv run mypy .`
4. **Run tests**: `uv run pytest --cov=pycsr_example`
5. **Generate reports**: `quarto render`

### Pre-commit automation

You can automate these checks using Git hooks (not covered in this book),
but manual execution provides better learning and control during development.

## Clinical project structure guidelines

In case you need clinical reporting projects using both R and Python:

**Separate R and Python directories:**

```
project/
├── r-package/          # R package for R-based analyses
│   ├── DESCRIPTION
│   ├── R/
│   └── tests/
├── python-package/     # Python package for Python-based analyses
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── data/               # Shared input data (SDTM, ADaM)
└── output/             # Shared output (TLFs, reports)
```

**Why separate?** There are a few reasons:

- Different build systems.
- Different dependency management.
- Different testing frameworks.
- Different IDE configurations.

**Shared resources:**

- Input datasets (SDTM, ADaM) can be in a common `data/` directory.
- Output deliverables can go to a common `output/` directory.
- Documentation can reference both implementations.

::: callout-note
For this book, we focus exclusively on Python.
Mixed R/Python workflows are beyond scope but follow the same principles.

## Exercise

Set up a complete development environment:

1. Create a new project with `uv init dev-practice`.
2. Add development dependencies: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pytest-cov`.
3. Create a simple function in `src/dev_practice/stats.py`:
   ```python
   def mean(values: list[float]) -> float:
       return sum(values) / len(values)
   ```
4. Write a test in `tests/test_stats.py`.
5. Run Ruff format and check.
6. Run mypy type checking.
7. Run pytest with coverage.

```bash
# Create project
uv init dev-practice
cd dev-practice

# Add dev dependencies
uv add --dev ruff mypy pytest pytest-cov

# Create stats module
mkdir -p src/dev_practice
cat > src/dev_practice/stats.py << 'EOF'
def mean(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Calculate the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers."""
    if not values:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate mean of empty list")
    return sum(values) / len(values)
EOF

# Create test file
mkdir -p tests
cat > tests/test_stats.py << 'EOF'
import pytest
from dev_practice.stats import mean

def test_mean_basic():
    assert mean([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) == 2.0

def test_mean_single_value():
    assert mean([5.0]) == 5.0

def test_mean_empty_raises():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        mean([])
EOF

# Run checks
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest --cov=dev_practice --cov-report=term
```

Expected output from pytest:

```
